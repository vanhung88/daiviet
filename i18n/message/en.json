    "about1": "Legends of Dai Viet: Two Emperors invites you into the Vietnamese underworld of departed souls beyond mortal existence. Inspired by a turning point in Vietnam’s history, the 13th-century Lý–Trần dynastic transition, it blends poetic storytelling steeped in Vietnamese culture. As a wayward unknown seeking reincarnation, you must undergo spiritual trials to transcend worldly attachments, challenge the Viet ancient heroes and the spiritual wisdom of Vietnam’s traditions. Along the way, you’ll explore quests and relics drawn from folklore, encountering legendary dragons, emperors, and spirits that bring Vietnam’s mythic past to life.",
    "about2": "At the heart of this journey is a deep Ngũ Hành (Five Elements) system that shapes every battle, build, and boss. There are no traditional level-ups. Instead, power comes from understanding your build and mastering the five elements. This elemental combat design rewards creative builds and skilful counterplay. Your foes, which include towering bosses from legend, wield the same elemental forces of Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water as you, turning each encounter into a test of strategy and adaptation. Legends of Dai Viet: Two Emperors carries a passionate indie spirit, striving to expand Vietnamese identity on the global stage by delivering an experience of elegant challenge, cultural depth, and profound meaning.",
